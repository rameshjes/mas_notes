## Install Python without sudo rights on remote machine


Enter the following commands to download and extract Python 2.7 to your hosting account.
        mkdir ~/python
        
        cd ~/python
        
        wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/Python-2.7.2.tgz
        
        tar zxfv Python-2.7.2.tgz
        
        find ~/python -type d | xargs chmod 0755

Once extracted you can use the following commands to configure and install Python.

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/python
        
        make
        
        make install
