create filename with  test_  

create function with name suffix test_

python -m pytest // it searches file with test_ suffix and test that function
or 
py.test 

** To test particular file:
	py.test file_name

** To check which methods were tested

python -m pytest -v // -v for verbose


** we can also test one particular function; by putting condition 
import pytest // in test file

before function starts; write: @pytest.mark.skip(reason = "optional reason")

you can see that run while running test:
	pytest -v -rxs         


** you also test particular function ; 
pytest -k multiply  // it will test function having name "multiply" in that

pytest -k multiple -v // for more summary
